This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a complex or improperly configured build system. It manifests as an unexpected error during the build process, where the Expo CLI might fail to correctly resolve dependencies or handle configuration settings.  The specific error message can vary greatly, but often involves build failures, missing modules, or issues related to native modules or platform-specific configurations.  For example, you might see errors related to missing frameworks, incorrect linking of native libraries, or incompatibility between versions of Expo modules and your project's dependencies.
