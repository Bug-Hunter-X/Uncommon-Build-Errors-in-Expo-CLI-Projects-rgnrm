# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Errors

This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon build error encountered when using the Expo CLI, along with its solution.  The error typically arises from complex project configurations, dependency conflicts, or issues related to native modules.

## Problem Description

Expo CLI build failures can sometimes be difficult to debug.  These errors often don't provide clear guidance, making it challenging to pinpoint the source of the issue. This repository demonstrates a scenario where subtle configuration problems lead to an unexpected build failure.

## Solution

The solution often involves meticulously reviewing the project's configuration files, dependency versions, and the logs produced during the build process.  In some cases, temporary workarounds might be required until a more comprehensive solution can be found.  This repository offers a practical example of troubleshooting and resolving such a scenario.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Attempt to build the project using Expo CLI (e.g., `expo build:android`).
4. Observe the uncommon build error.  The specific error message may vary depending on the setup.
5. Apply the solution outlined in `uncommonExpoSolution.js` to correct the error.
