The solution depends on the exact nature of the error. However, a common approach involves carefully examining the Expo CLI build logs for detailed information about the error.  This might reveal incorrect dependency versions, misconfigurations, or issues with native modules.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix such errors:

1. **Check Dependency Versions:** Ensure all dependencies in your `package.json` are compatible with each other and the current Expo version. Review the error messages carefully to identify any conflicting dependencies.
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Clean your project's build cache. On some systems, manually deleting the `.expo` folder can resolve cached issues.
3. **Examine Native Module Integrations:** If the error involves native modules, verify that they are correctly linked and configured according to the module's documentation.
4. **Review Configuration Files:** Check your `app.json` or `expo.json` for any potential misconfigurations that might be causing the error.
5. **Update Expo CLI:**  Ensure you're using the latest version of Expo CLI (`expo update`).
6. **Simplify the Project (Temporary):** To isolate the problem, temporarily create a minimal, stripped-down version of your project to see if the error persists. This can help rule out contributing factors.
7. **Community Support:** Search for similar errors in the Expo community forums or GitHub issues. Often, others have encountered the same problem and found solutions.
